i have been feeling strong and optimistic and then bam
i feel a divine calling to become an lsd chemist the pub shroomery message board link href smarty templates css www
i do not know what to do in my current space to make myself feel more comfortable
i feel so smart even though its really easy to do haha
i could have just kept going but i could tell that she was feeling really defeated and needed a friend
insulted by disgusting people
i was feeling a bit disheartened until one of our black belt instructors at the dojo richard and i own asked why let anyone else set your destiny
i want him to feel emotional pain
i feel it isnt enough times i dont feel respected or special or that this relationship is good for me
i feel really lucky to be part of it
i set off feeling strangely nervous and quite weak but slowly worked through the problems and was soon attempting the toughest problems
i headed back to my office feeling satisfied maybe even a bit self righteous about how id consoled a friend
i know i have an international audience but even now i feel pleasantly shocked that i can reach certain parts of the world
i was feeling remorseful about my breakfast and so i took a diet pill
i mean the blinds that you could pull down when you were feeling particularly romantic
i didn t really feel awkward at all
i do feel apprehensive before meeting someone new particularly in a group situation but i just sign up for everything i can and hope that i ll have found the courage to do it by the time it comes round and i always have so far
i feel disturbed today
i like the small town feel and friendly open polite conversations
i know i am feeling discouraged and cynical
